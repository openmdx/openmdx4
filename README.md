# Welcome to openMDX 4

The purpose of this repository is to ensure the simplest possible migration from “openMDX for Jakarta EE 8” to “openMDX for Jakarta EE 10”.

This repository is a fork of the openMDX 4 flavour of the multi-source edition of [openMDX](https://github.com/openmdx/openmdx). This repository does not use a [Java precompiler])https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold/tree/master/manifold-deps-parent/manifold-preprocessor). This allowed all '#if #else #endif' directives in the sources to be removed. This greatly simplifies the build process and the support of various IDEs without specific plugins. [openMDX](https://github.com/openmdx/openmdx) and [openMDX 4](https://github.com/openmdx/openmdx4) will be merged in the future as soon as the single-source support is not rquired anymore.

Features will ported from [openMDX](https://github.com/openmdx/openmdx) on a regular basis.
