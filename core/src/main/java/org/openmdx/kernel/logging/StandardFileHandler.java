/**
 * Simple file logging <tt>Handler</tt>.
 * <p>
 * The <tt>StreamingFileHandler</tt> can either write to a specified file,
 * or it can write to a rotating set of files.  
 * <p>
 * For a rotating set of files, as each file reaches a given size
 * limit, it is closed, rotated out, and a new file opened.
 * Successively older files are named by adding "0", "1", "2", 
 * etc into the base filename.
 * <p>
 * By default buffering is enabled in the IO libraries but each log
 * record is flushed out when it is complete. 
 * <p>
 * The {@code FallbackFileHandler} is able to support {@code Formattter}s 
 * implementing {@code FormatWithouThrown}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Configuration:</b>
 * By default each <tt>FileHandler</tt> is initialized using the following
 * <tt>LogManager</tt> configuration properties.  If properties are not defined
 * (or have invalid values) then the specified default values are used.
 * <ul>
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.level 
 *    specifies the default level for the <tt>Handler</tt>
 *    (defaults to <tt>Level.ALL</tt>).
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.filter 
 *    specifies the name of a <tt>Filter</tt> class to use
 *    (defaults to no <tt>Filter</tt>).
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter 
 *    specifies the name of a <tt>Formatter</tt> class to use
 *        (defaults to <tt>java.util.logging.XMLFormatter</tt>)
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.encoding 
 *    the name of the character set encoding to use (defaults to
 *    the default platform encoding).
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit 
 *    specifies an approximate maximum amount to write (in bytes)
 *    to any one file.  If this is zero, then there is no limit.
 *    (Defaults to no limit).
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.count 
 *    specifies how many output files to cycle through (defaults to 1).
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern 
 *    specifies a pattern for generating the output file name.  See
 *        below for details. (Defaults to "%h/java%u.log").
 * <li>   java.util.logging.FileHandler.append
 *    specifies whether the FileHandler should append onto
 *        any existing files (defaults to false).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * A pattern consists of a string that includes the following special
 * components that will be replaced at runtime:
 * <ul>
 * <li>    "/"    the local pathname separator 
 * <li>     "%t"   the system temporary directory
 * <li>     "%h"   the value of the "user.home" system property
 * <li>     "%g"   the generation number to distinguish rotated logs
 * <li>     "%u"   a unique number to resolve conflicts
 * <li>     "%%"   translates to a single percent sign "%"
 * </ul>
 * If no "%g" field has been specified and the file count is greater
 * than one, then the generation number will be added to the end of
 * the generated filename, after a dot.
 * <p> 
 * Thus for example a pattern of "%t/java%g.log" with a count of 2
 * would typically cause log files to be written on Solaris to 
 * /var/tmp/java0.log and /var/tmp/java1.log whereas on Windows 95 they
 * would be typically written to C:\TEMP\java0.log and C:\TEMP\java1.log
 * <p> 
 * Generation numbers follow the sequence 0, 1, 2, etc.
 * <p>
 * Normally the "%u" unique field is set to 0.  However, if the <tt>FileHandler</tt>
 * tries to open the filename and finds the file is currently in use by
 * another process it will increment the unique number field and try
 * again.  This will be repeated until <tt>FileHandler</tt> finds a file name that
 * is  not currently in use. If there is a conflict and no "%u" field has
 * been specified, it will be added at the end of the filename after a dot.
 * (This will be after any automatically added generation number.)
 * <p>
 * Thus if three processes were all trying to log to fred%u.%g.txt then 
 * they  might end up using fred0.0.txt, fred1.0.txt, fred2.0.txt as
 * the first file in their rotating sequences.
 * <p>
 * Note that the use of unique ids to avoid conflicts is only guaranteed
 * to work reliably when using a local disk file system.
